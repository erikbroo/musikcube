The general layout is to place a listbox with settings categories on the left side (as in most applications). Clicking on one opens a dialog template with category-specific settings on the right side of the dialog. Following I will provide the hierarchy of the configuration. Please add your configurations options with descriptions:

  * Library
    * Paths
  * Remote Libraries
    * Add/Remove/Modify(?)
  * Client / Server
    * Authorization
    * Port settings
  * Audio Settings
    * Output
  * Display
    * Ordering
    * Tray Settings
      * Show tray icon
      * Minimize to tray

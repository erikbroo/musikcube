musikCube’s goal is to make your music collection easily accessible.  We can summarize the priorities in a few key points:
  * Music: musikCube is about enjoying your music collection.  So we support a lot of different audio types.  However, we don’t go out of our way to support features that are not related to finding and playing music from your collection.
  * Usability: we want to offer a package with enough features you need to enjoy your collection, big or small, and with a simple, no frills GUI.
  * Portability: we want to make it easy to take your collection and enjoy it on various machines.  This means it is easy to take the database and the program with you and that musikCube will be available on different platforms.
  * Non-intrusive: musikCube does not make assumptions about the way your collection is organized nor does it want to enforce any organization.  It also avoids polluting your system.
  * Extensible: it is possible to write plugins to add advanced features that do not fit in the base package.
  * Optimal use of system resources: we don’t want to use too much memory or put a high load on the processor just for playing some music from your collection.

These goals help us prioritize the feature requests.  Of course as we make progress in our releases these goals might change over time.
